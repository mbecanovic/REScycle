# REScycle

App Idea: Our app simplifies and enhances the recycling experience. It allows users to scan QR codes from Smart Bins and automatically earn points for each recycled item. Each Smart Bin is equipped with a sensor and counter that records every deposited item, such as a glass bottle. When a user scans the QR code, the points associated with the recycled material are automatically transferred to their account. (point can be visible on account page)

Additionally, the app features an interactive map that shows the user's current location as well as the locations of Smart Bins. This way, users can easily locate the nearest Smart Bins and use them quickly, increasing motivation for recycling and contributing to environmental preservation.

Users can redeem their points for exclusive benefits with partner businesses. The app allows them to activate and view current promotions, as well as browse through a list of partners and search for specific offers. Users can download coupons as long as they have points, with each coupon valued at 20 points (note that the value may vary depending on the offer). User can see activated coupons on account page.

To redeem a coupon, users simply need to present the QR code to the retailer at the store where they wish to use it. This process ensures a seamless experience for accessing rewards and enjoying promotions at partner locations.
